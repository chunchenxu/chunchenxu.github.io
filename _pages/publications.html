            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Digital environments today often lack affordances that cultivate a sense of place and embodied being and acting. We develop a theoretical framework for embodied place-making based on people's psychological tendency to balance structure (clarity, predictability, and certainty) with unstructuredness (openness and possibility). This framework provides a unified theoretical foundation for examining continuity and discontinuity in social psychological processes and behaviors across digital, physical, and natural environments. We illustrate this framework through an original story (<em>NewsWood</em>) that reconceptualizes digital news reading as an experience akin to wandering through woods. We hope to inspire radical reimagining of how future digital environments can foster well-being across individuals, communities, societies, and the natural world within their interconnected relationships.

            <strong>Abstract:</strong> The anthropocentric cultural idea that humans are active agents exerting control over their environments has been largely normalized and inscribed in practices, policies, and products of contemporary industrialized societies. This view underlies a human-ecology relationship based on resource and knowledge extraction. To create a more sustainable and equitable future, it is essential to consider alternative cultural ideas rooted in ecological thinking. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness between humans and more-than-human worlds. We propose a path to reshape the human-ecology relationship by advocating for alternative human-AI interactions. In this paper, we undertake a critical comparison between anthropocentrism and ecological thinking, using storytelling to illustrate various human-AI interactions that embody ecological thinking. We also delineate a set of design principles aimed at guiding AI developments toward fostering a more caring human-ecology relationship.
