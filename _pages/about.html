<div class="about-container">

<p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Psychology at Stanford University, working with Professors <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hazelm/">Hazel Rose Markus</a> and <a href="https://psychology.stanford.edu/people/jeanne-l-tsai/">Jeanne L. Tsai</a>. As a behavioral scientist and cultural scholar, I explore how culture influences our ability to live in just and caring relations—with one another and with the natural worlds. I approach “culture” as historically derived meaning frameworks and their enactments in individual psyches, interpersonal interactions, social practices, artifacts, and institutions. My research aims to build and apply <em>a science of meaning</em> to enable understanding and collaboration across differences in addressing societal and plantary challenges. I believe the presence of the “other” is of a gifted nature, not to be feared, denied, or controlled, but to be in creative and enriching relations with. </p> 

<p>Methodologically, I pursue a mode of inquiry that is both empirical and imaginative, elevating overlooked experiences, practices, and knowledge to foster possibilities of care and justice. I integrate surveys and experiments, cultural product analysis, fabulation, and participatory methods. </p>

My recent research has been supported by the <a href="https://sustainability-accelerator.stanford.edu/">Sustainability Accelerator</a> at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, and <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/">Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a>.

I was born in a lovely small city with a lot of rivers and lakes in Jiangsu Province, China. I later came to the U.S. for graduate school. I received my Ph.D. from Stanford Graduate School of Business, where I was lucky to be advised by Professor <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/brian-lowery">Brian S. Lowery</a>. Outside research, I also make poems, songs, and dance pieces usually together with my ukulele.
