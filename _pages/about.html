<div class="about-container">

As a behavioral scientist and cultural scholar, I explore how culture influences our ability to live in just and caring relations—with one another and with the natural world. 
  
<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<div class="content-section">
My work focuses on three interconnected areas that shape human decision-making. First, I examine how social context influences individual choices, exploring questions about conformity, social learning, and peer effects in environments ranging from financial markets to health behaviors. Second, I investigate decision-making under uncertainty, particularly how people process probabilistic information and manage risk in both personal and professional contexts. Third, I study the behavioral foundations of economic phenomena, using insights from psychology to better understand market behavior, policy effectiveness, and organizational dynamics.

<h2>Current Projects</h2>

<div class="content-section">
I am currently leading several research initiatives that bridge laboratory and field settings. One line of work examines how social networks shape the spread of information and influence decision-making in online communities. Another project investigates the role of cognitive biases in financial decision-making, with implications for both individual investors and market stability. Additionally, I am collaborating with policymakers to design and evaluate behavioral interventions aimed at improving health outcomes and environmental sustainability.

<h2>Approach</h2>

<div class="content-section">
Methodologically, I pursue a mode of inquiry that is both empirical and imaginative, elevating overlooked experiences, practices, and knowledge to foster possibilities of care and justice. I integrate surveys and experiments, cultural product analysis, fabulation, and participatory methods. Throughout my work, I approach “culture” as historically derived meaning frameworks and their enactments in individual psyches, interpersonal interactions, social practices, artifacts, and institutions. I aim to build a science of meaning that enables collaboration across differences.

<h2>Background</h2>

<div class="content-section">
I was born in a lovely small city with a lot of rivers and lakes in Jiangsu Province, China. I later came to the U.S. for graduate school. I received my Ph.D. from Stanford Graduate School of Business, where I was lucky to be advised by Professor Brian S. Lowery. Since then, I have been working with Professors Hazel Rose Markus and Jeanne L. Tsai on research related to culture, creativity and climate action.
