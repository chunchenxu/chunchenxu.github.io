<div class="about-container">

As a behavioral scientist and cultural scholar, I explore how culture influences our ability to live in just and caring relations—with one another and with the natural worlds. 

Methodologically, I pursue a mode of inquiry that is both empirical and imaginative, elevating overlooked experiences, practices, and knowledge to foster possibilities of care and justice. I integrate surveys and experiments, cultural product analysis, fabulation, and participatory methods. Throughout my work, I approach “culture” as historically derived meaning frameworks and their enactments in individual psyches, interpersonal interactions, social practices, artifacts, and institutions. I aim to build a science of meaning that enables collaboration across differences.

My recent research has been supported by the Sustainability Accelerator at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, and Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI.

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

<div class="content-section">
I was born in a lovely small city with a lot of rivers and lakes in Jiangsu Province, China. I later came to the U.S. for graduate school. I received my Ph.D. from Stanford Graduate School of Business, where I was lucky to be advised by Professor Brian S. Lowery. Since then, I have been working with Professors Hazel Rose Markus and Jeanne L. Tsai on research related to culture, creativity and climate action. Outside research, I also make poems, songs, and dance pieces usually together with my ukulele.
