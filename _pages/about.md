<div class="about-container">

I am a behavioral scientist investigating how people make decisions in complex social and economic environments. My research combines experimental methods, computational modeling, and field studies to understand the psychological mechanisms underlying human choice behavior.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<div class="content-section">
My work focuses on three interconnected areas that shape human decision-making. First, I examine how social context influences individual choices, exploring questions about conformity, social learning, and peer effects in environments ranging from financial markets to health behaviors. Second, I investigate decision-making under uncertainty, particularly how people process probabilistic information and manage risk in both personal and professional contexts. Third, I study the behavioral foundations of economic phenomena, using insights from psychology to better understand market behavior, policy effectiveness, and organizational dynamics.

<h2>Current Projects</h2>

<div class="content-section">
I am currently leading several research initiatives that bridge laboratory and field settings. One line of work examines how social networks shape the spread of information and influence decision-making in online communities. Another project investigates the role of cognitive biases in financial decision-making, with implications for both individual investors and market stability. Additionally, I am collaborating with policymakers to design and evaluate behavioral interventions aimed at improving health outcomes and environmental sustainability.

<h2>Approach</h2>

<div class="content-section">
My research philosophy centers on methodological rigor combined with real-world relevance. I believe that understanding human behavior requires multiple complementary approaches: controlled laboratory experiments to isolate causal mechanisms, computational models to formalize theoretical predictions, and field studies to test external validity. This multi-method approach allows me to build robust theories while maintaining practical applicability.

<h2>Beyond Research</h2>

<div class="content-section">
When I'm not in the lab or analyzing data, I enjoy mentoring students and engaging with broader conversations about the role of behavioral science in addressing societal challenges. I regularly contribute to policy discussions and work with organizations to translate research insights into practical applications.

As a behavioral scientist and cultural scholar, I explore how culture influences our ability to live in just and caring relationsâ€”with one another and with the natural world.
